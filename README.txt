Greetings. I present to you a fun math game which was inspired by my favorite serbian quiz (Slagalica). Basically, you get a bunch of random numbers, and you try to use them to get the goal number, which is also random.
It's still a demo because I plan on adding an Interface, a real interface with JavaFX which would make it easier for non-programming people to use. Goodluck!
